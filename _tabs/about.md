## What's this?
This is a blog about making things: the ideas, and the implementations. There's going to be stuff about fun things like puzzles, games & stories - things I've made in the past, and what I'm making now - but there's going to be some technical stuff about software development, ASP.NET Core, cloud deployments and AI too. In my heart and in my practice, these things are inseparable, so I've stopped trying to treat them differently. 

## Who's Mat Burtcher?
I'm a solutions designer and senior .NET developer at DSys Plus Ltd. I work with clients from charities to major businesses to forge web applications, database interfaces, API integrations and other cool services so they can achieve their goals and get more time to do the important things in life.

I'm also the Creative Director at BurtcherWay Ltd., specialising in delivering sometimes strange, always unique interactive experiences. We make games, puzzles, events and shows, both purely digital and out in the world. 

I've learned over almost two decades of working creatively with software that there isn't so much difference between those two roles as you might think. Like everyone else, I love to learn and explore, and I try not to pigeonhole myself or the paths I take too much.

I love reading, playing games and being with my family, ideally by the sea here in West Sussex, with our dog Billie Joel.
